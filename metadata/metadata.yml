description: The Personal Cancer Genome Reporter (PCGR) is a stand-alone software
  package for functional annotation and translation of individual tumor genomes for
  precision cancer medicine. It interprets primarily somatic SNVs/InDels and copy
  number aberrations, and has additional support for interpretation of bulk RNA-seq
  expression data. The software classifies variants both with respect to oncogenicity,
  and actionability. Interactive HTML output reports allow the user to interrogate
  the clinical impact of the molecular findings in an individual tumor.
